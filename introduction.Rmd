### Introduction

<img src="data/EMA_small.png" width="20%" align="right" /> The present report was compiled by the Course Quality Advisory Board (CQAB) of the Erasmus Mundus Student and Alumni Association (EMA) with the main purpose of providing all stakeholders access to the results of the  2015 edition of the Course Quality Student Services (CQSS) survey.

CQAB is eager to receive further feedback from stakeholders on how future CQSS products and their contents may be improved in order to maximize their usefulness. We understand that courses themselves are best suited to address quality concerns, and we strongly suggest that present information, with its limitations, is triangulated with other available data for each course.

### Individual programs

The interactive tool (tab **"Individual programs"**) provides information about EMJMD programs that received 10 or more answers in the CQSS survey.

It introduces two distinct sources of information. **First**, responses are displayed in graphical form for each indicator and dimension captured in the CQSS survey. Questions appears as the figure or dimension title, with each comprising indicator listed on a separate row. The figure below illustrates the proportion of respondents that selected each of the four available Likert scale options.

**Second**, for each indicator evaluated through the CQSS survey, comparative data on the aggregated performance among all EMJMD courses with 10 or more responses is introduced.
